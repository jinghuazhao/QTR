This is illustrated with the documentation example.

We first run a simple linear regression,
```{r}
require(lme4)
l <- lm(Reaction ~ Days, sleepstudy)
summary(l)
```
Paying attention to the P values and also the F statistics which is simply $t^2$. Next we turn to the mixed model containing a random effect
```{r}
f <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), sleepstudy)
s <- summary(f)
s
class(with(s,coefficients))
t <- with(s,coefficients)[,3]
p <- 2*(1-pnorm(abs(t)))
p
```
So the P values are very close, giving a sense of what both models are about.
