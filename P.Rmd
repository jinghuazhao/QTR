This is illustrated with the documentation example.

We first run a simple linear regression,
```{r}
require(lme4)
l <- lm(Reaction ~ Days, sleepstudy)
s <- summary(l)
s
names(s)
class(s)
round(sqrt(s$fstatistic[1]),3)
```
the F statistics is simply $t^2$. Next we turn to the mixed model containing a random effect
```{r}
f <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), sleepstudy)
s <- summary(f)
s
names(s)
class(with(s,coefficients))
t <- with(s,coefficients)[,3]
p <- 2*(pnorm(-abs(t)))
p
```
We can see that the P value on `Days` became larger after accounting for individual differences.
